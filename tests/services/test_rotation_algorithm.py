"""
Tests for Rotation Algorithm Service

This test suite validates the circular rotation algorithm that assigns team members
to on-call shifts. The algorithm must:
- Rotate members through shifts fairly and predictably
- Handle various team sizes (1 to 10+ members)
- Support any number of shifts
- Generate timezone-aware datetimes (America/Chicago)
- Return data compatible with ScheduleRepository.bulk_create()

Test organization:
- Basic functionality tests
- Edge case tests (small/large teams, odd scenarios)
- Error condition tests
- DateTime and timezone tests
- Integration tests with real database
