Tests for Schedule Service

This test suite validates the ScheduleService, which coordinates schedule
generation, persistence, and queries. The service integrates the rotation
algorithm with database operations.

Test organization:
- Basic schedule generation
- Query operations (current week, upcoming, date ranges)
- Regeneration when team changes
- Error conditions and validation
- Integration with rotation algorithm
