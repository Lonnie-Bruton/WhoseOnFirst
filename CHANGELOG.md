## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Docker Base Image Migration to UBI9** - Migrated from `python:3.11-slim` to `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/python-312` for Kubernetes/enterprise deployment compatibility ([WHO-5](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/WHO-5))
  - **Purpose**: Enable deployment to corporate Kubernetes clusters using Red Hat Universal Base Image
  - **Base Image**: `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/python-312` (RHEL 9 with Python 3.12)
  - **Key Changes**:
    - Removed apt-get commands (UBI9 uses dnf and has build tools pre-installed)
    - Added `USER 0` directives for root operations (UBI9 runs as non-root by default)
    - Updated pip install to use UBI9 site-packages path (`/opt/app-root/lib/python3.12/site-packages`)
    - Changed CMD to use `python -m` syntax for cross-platform compatibility
  - **Dev Dependencies Updated for Python 3.12**:
    - pytest-asyncio: 0.21.1 → 0.23.0
    - black: 23.12.0 → 24.1.0
    - mypy: 1.7.1 → 1.8.0
  - **Offline Installer**: Updated to version 1.1.0 with UBI9 image references
  - **Verification**: Container builds, starts, passes health checks, all scheduler jobs initialize correctly
  - **Impact**: WhoseOnFirst is now compatible with enterprise Kubernetes deployments using Red Hat container registry

### Fixed

- **Viewer User Dashboard Loading Bug** - Fixed dashboard failing to load for viewer role users ([WHO-33](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/WHO-33))
  - **Issue**: When logged in as viewer, dashboard showed "Loading..." forever with console error: `Error loading dashboard data: Error: Failed to fetch data`
  - **Root Cause**: GET endpoints for schedule-overrides used `require_admin` instead of `require_auth`, returning 403 Forbidden for viewer users. Dashboard error handling treated any failed fetch as fatal.
  - **Solution**: Changed read-only override endpoints from `require_admin` to `require_auth`:
    - `GET /api/v1/schedule-overrides/` - List overrides (line 90)
    - `GET /api/v1/schedule-overrides/active` - Active overrides for dashboard (line 131)
    - `GET /api/v1/schedule-overrides/{id}` - Single override details (line 161)
  - **Preserved Admin-Only**: Mutation endpoints remain `require_admin` (POST create, DELETE cancel, POST complete-past)
  - **Files Changed**: `src/api/routes/schedule_overrides.py` (import + 3 endpoint permissions + docstrings)
  - **Impact**: Viewer users can now see dashboard with full data including override indicators

- **Completed Overrides Not Showing on Dashboard** - Fixed calendar not displaying overrides after status transitions to 'completed' ([WHO-34](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/WHO-34))
  - **Issue**: Dashboard calendar only showed override indicators (orange badges) for 'active' overrides. Once WHO-30 scheduler job transitioned status from 'active' to 'completed', calendar reverted to showing original scheduled person instead of who actually covered.
  - **Root Cause**: Triple filter problem - override display was filtered at multiple levels all checking only `status='active'`:
    - Repository: `get_active_overrides()` filtered `.filter(status == 'active')`
    - Frontend filter: `findOverrideForSchedule()` checked `o.status === 'active'`
    - Frontend fetch: Used `?status=active` query parameter
  - **Solution**: Modified all layers to include both 'active' AND 'completed' overrides (excluding 'cancelled'):
    - Renamed `get_active_overrides()` → `get_display_overrides()` for semantic accuracy
    - Changed filter to `.filter(status.in_(['active', 'completed']))`
    - Updated frontend to use `/active` endpoint and accept both statuses
    - Fixed response parsing to handle both array and object response shapes
  - **Files Changed**:
    - `src/repositories/schedule_override_repository.py` (method rename + filter update)
    - `src/api/routes/schedule_overrides.py` (endpoint update + docstring)
    - `frontend/index.html` (fetch URL + filter function + response parsing)
  - **Impact**: All completed overrides now display correctly on calendar with orange badges

### Security

- **Fixed innerHTML XSS Vulnerability in Sidebar Loader** - Replaced innerHTML with DOMParser for safer HTML parsing ([WHO-25](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/WHO-25))
  - **Issue**: Codacy flagged 3 XSS vulnerabilities (2 Critical, 1 High) at `frontend/js/sidebar-loader.js:21` for unsafe `innerHTML` assignment
  - **Risk Assessment**: Low actual risk (sidebar HTML is static), but best practice to fix for defense-in-depth
  - **Solution**: Replaced `temp.innerHTML = sidebarHTML` with `DOMParser.parseFromString()` which parses HTML in an isolated context without executing scripts
  - **Files Changed**: `frontend/js/sidebar-loader.js` (lines 19-24)
  - **Impact**: Eliminates Codacy XSS warnings, follows OWASP security best practices

## [1.4.0] - 2025-12-02

### Added

- **Manual Schedule Override System** - Full CRUD UI and backend for manually overriding schedule assignments ([WHO-14](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/WHO-14))
  - **Purpose**: Allow admins to manually override on-call schedules for vacation, sick days, shift swaps, or emergency coverage without affecting rotation algorithm
  - **Status**: ✅ **Complete** - All features implemented and tested
  - **Features**:
    - Create, view, edit, cancel, and delete schedule overrides via dedicated UI page
    - Override member can be any team member (active OR inactive) - allows supervisors to cover shifts
    - Overrides respect member colors on dashboard (inactive members use gray background)
    - Real-time override indicators on dashboard calendar and escalation chain (orange badges with swap icons)
    - Daily SMS notifications sent to override member instead of originally scheduled member
    - Weekly escalation summary shows override members with correct contact info
    - Overrides are non-destructive - original schedule remains unchanged, resolution happens at display/notification time
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Backend**:
      - `src/models/schedule_override.py` - SQLAlchemy model with status tracking and audit fields
      - `src/repositories/schedule_override_repository.py` - Repository layer with override queries
      - `src/services/schedule_override_service.py` - Business logic with validation (no is_active check)
      - `src/api/routes/schedule_overrides.py` - REST API with CRUD endpoints
      - `src/services/sms_service.py:414-459` - Updated _compose_message() to check for overrides
      - `src/services/sms_service.py:150-219` - Updated send_notification() to send to override member
      - `src/services/sms_service.py:514-550` - Updated weekly summary to show override members
    - **Database**:
      - New table: `schedule_overrides` with columns: id, schedule_id (FK), override_member_id (FK), original_member_id (FK), reason, status, override_member_name (snapshot), original_member_name (snapshot), created_at, created_by, updated_at, cancelled_at, notes
      - Migration: `alembic/versions/XXX_add_schedule_overrides.py`
    - **API**:
      - `GET /api/v1/schedule-overrides/` - List all overrides with filtering (status, date range)
      - `GET /api/v1/schedule-overrides/{id}` - Retrieve single override
      - `POST /api/v1/schedule-overrides/` - Create new override
      - `PUT /api/v1/schedule-overrides/{id}` - Update override reason/notes
      - `DELETE /api/v1/schedule-overrides/{id}/cancel` - Cancel override (soft delete)
      - `DELETE /api/v1/schedule-overrides/{id}/permanent` - Hard delete override (admin-only)
    - **Frontend**:
      - `frontend/schedule-overrides.html` - Full CRUD UI with modal dialogs (600+ lines)
      - `frontend/index.html:364-772` - Dashboard integration with override indicators
      - Override resolution helper: `findOverrideForSchedule()` checks active overrides per schedule
      - Visual indicators: Orange badges with white text, swap icons, "Covering for [Name]" tooltips
  - **Validation Rules**:
    - Schedule must exist and not be in the past
    - Override member must exist (no longer requires is_active flag)
    - Override member must be different from original assignee
    - No duplicate active override for same schedule
  - **Display-Time Resolution Pattern**:
    - Frontend fetches overrides once per page load
    - For each schedule, checks if active override exists
    - If override exists: display override member with orange badge
    - If no override: display original scheduled member
    - Same pattern used in daily notifications and weekly summary

### Fixed

- **Weekly Summary Sent Wrong Week** - Fixed off-by-one bug causing weekly escalation SMS to show next week instead of current week ([WHO-31](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/WHO-31))
  - **Issue**: Monday 8:00 AM weekly summary showed Dec 8-14 schedule instead of Dec 1-7 schedule
  - **Root Cause**: Date calculation at `schedule_manager.py:555` used `>=` operator which triggered at exactly 8:00 AM
  - **Solution**: Changed `now.hour >= 8` to `now.hour > 8` so scheduled job at 8:00 AM gets current week
  - **Files Changed**: `src/scheduler/schedule_manager.py:555`
  - **Impact**: Weekly escalation contacts now receive correct week's schedule

- **Inactive Team Members Now Allowed in Overrides** - Removed is_active validation that prevented using inactive members in overrides
  - **Issue**: Schedule override creation blocked inactive team members (like supervisors), even though is_active flag only controls rotation eligibility
  - **Root Cause**: Validation in `schedule_override_service.py` line 82-83 checked `is_active` flag
  - **Solution**: Removed is_active validation - override eligibility is independent of rotation eligibility
  - **Files Changed**: `src/services/schedule_override_service.py:78-81`, `src/api/routes/schedule_overrides.py:41`
  - **Impact**: Inactive members (like Ken U) can now be assigned to cover shifts via overrides

- **Notification Log Records Override Member Name** - Fixed notification history displaying original member instead of override member ([WHO-29](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/WHO-29))
  - **Issue**: When override was active, notification log recorded original scheduled member name instead of override member
  - **Solution**: Updated SMS service to pass override member name to notification logging
  - **Files Changed**: `src/services/sms_service.py`
  - **Impact**: Notification history now accurately shows who received the SMS

- **Override Status Lifecycle** - Added automated status transition from 'active' to 'completed' ([WHO-30](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/WHO-30))
  - **Issue**: Active overrides remained 'active' indefinitely after schedule date passed; "Completed" count always showed 0
  - **Root Cause**: No automated job existed to transition status
  - **Solution**: Added daily scheduler job at 8:05 AM CST to complete past overrides
  - **Implementation**:
    - New scheduler job: `complete_past_overrides()` at 8:05 AM daily (after notifications)
    - Repository method queries active overrides where `schedule.end_datetime < now`
    - Transitions status to 'completed' and sets `completed_at` timestamp
    - New migration: `d91648dc4f04_add_completed_at_to_schedule_overrides.py`
    - Manual trigger API: `POST /api/v1/schedule-overrides/complete-past`
  - **Files Changed**:
    - `src/models/schedule_override.py` - Added `completed_at` column
    - `src/repositories/schedule_override_repository.py` - Added `complete_past_overrides()` method
    - `src/services/schedule_override_service.py` - Added service wrapper
    - `src/scheduler/schedule_manager.py` - Added scheduler job at 8:05 AM
    - `src/api/routes/schedule_overrides.py` - Added manual trigger endpoint
  - **Impact**: Override History table now shows accurate completed counts

### Testing Notes

- **WHO-14 Override Testing** (Dec 2, 2025):
  - ✅ Daily SMS notifications correctly sent to override member
  - ✅ Dashboard displays orange override badges with correct member colors
  - ✅ Weekly summary shows override members with correct contact info
  - ✅ Weekly summary date bug identified and fixed (WHO-31)
  - ✅ Override completion status bug identified and fixed (WHO-30)
  - ✅ Manual trigger `/api/v1/schedule-overrides/complete-past` tested successfully - completed 3 past overrides
- **Test Overrides Created**: Ken U (11/28, 11/29), Matt C (11/28, 12/02), Lonnie B (11/27)
- **Next Steps**: Monitor automated completion job at 8:05 AM, verify WHO-31 fix on Monday 8:00 AM

## [1.3.1] - 2025-11-25

### Added

- **Notification History Pagination** - Server-side pagination for notification table with Tabler.io controls ([WHO-27](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/WHO-27))
  - **Purpose**: Improve performance and UX by loading only needed notifications instead of all 50+ records
  - **Features**:
    - Server-side pagination with configurable page size (10-100 items, default 25)
    - Tabler.io pagination controls with Prev/Next buttons and page numbers
    - Smart page number display (max 5 visible, centered around current page)
    - Pagination info display (e.g., "Showing 1-25 of 87 notifications")
    - Maintains current page on refresh button click
    - Boundary detection disables Prev/Next buttons at edges
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Backend**:
      - `src/repositories/notification_log_repository.py:321-375` - Modified `get_recent_logs()` to accept `offset` parameter, added `count_all()` method
      - `src/api/routes/notifications.py:8,30-92` - Added pagination query params (page, per_page), returns dict with pagination metadata
    - **API**:
      - `GET /api/v1/notifications/recent?page=1&per_page=25` - Paginated notification history
      - Query params: `page` (1-indexed, min 1), `per_page` (10-100, default 25)
      - Response includes: `notifications` array, `pagination` object with page/total/has_prev/has_next
    - **Frontend**:
      - `frontend/notifications.html:271-278` - Pagination footer with Tabler.io card-footer styling
      - `frontend/notifications.html:495-771` - JavaScript pagination state and control rendering
      - Smart centering: Adjusts visible page range based on current page position
  - **Performance Impact**: Reduced initial page load from 50 records to 25 records (50% reduction in payload size)
  - **Algorithm**: Standard LIMIT/OFFSET SQL pagination with `math.ceil()` for total pages calculation

### Fixed

- **Notification API Serialization Error** - Fixed 500 error when loading paginated notification history
  - **Issue**: "Error loading notification history" with `PydanticSerializationError: Unable to serialize unknown type: <class 'src.models.notification_log.NotificationLog'>`
  - **Root Cause**: API endpoint returned raw SQLAlchemy model objects in dictionary; FastAPI couldn't serialize them to JSON
  - **Solution**: Wrapped logs with `jsonable_encoder(logs)` to convert models to JSON-serializable dictionaries
  - **Files Changed**: `src/api/routes/notifications.py:8,83`
  - **Impact**: Pagination now loads correctly without errors

### Technical Notes

- **Pagination Pattern**: Repository → API → Frontend with LIMIT/OFFSET SQL queries
- **State Management**: Frontend maintains `currentPage` variable to persist pagination across refresh clicks
- **Serialization**: FastAPI requires explicit `jsonable_encoder()` for SQLAlchemy models in non-Pydantic responses
- **Page Calculation**: `offset = (page - 1) * per_page`, `total_pages = math.ceil(total / per_page)`

## [1.3.0] - 2025-11-25 (Beta)

### Added

- **Weekly Escalation Contact Schedule Summary** - Automated weekly SMS summaries sent to escalation contacts every Monday at 8:00 AM CST ([WHO-23](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/WHO-23))
  - **Purpose**: Provides escalation contacts (supervisors) with upcoming week's on-call schedule for planning purposes
  - **Features**:
    - Sends 7-day schedule summary (Monday-Sunday) to configured escalation contacts
    - Smart 48-hour shift handling - shows "Name +Phone (48h)" on first day, "Name (continues)" on second day
    - Toggle to enable/disable weekly summaries in Escalation Contacts modal
    - Manual "Test Weekly Summary Now" button for immediate testing
    - Scheduled via APScheduler (CronTrigger: Mondays 8:00 AM CST)
    - Integrates with existing escalation contact configuration
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Backend**:
      - `src/services/settings_service.py:374-398` - Weekly toggle setting (get/set methods)
      - `src/services/sms_service.py:442-556` - Message composition with continuation logic
      - `src/services/sms_service.py:794-961` - Send to all configured escalation contacts
      - `src/scheduler/schedule_manager.py:441-621` - Scheduled job + manual trigger wrapper
      - `src/scheduler/__init__.py:13,22` - Export trigger_weekly_summary_manually function
    - **API**:
      - `GET /api/v1/settings/escalation-weekly` - Retrieve weekly summary toggle state
      - `PUT /api/v1/settings/escalation-weekly` - Update weekly summary toggle (admin-only)
      - `POST /api/v1/schedules/notifications/weekly-summary/trigger` - Manual trigger for testing (admin-only)
    - **Frontend**:
      - `frontend/team-members.html:394-422` - Weekly Summary section in Escalation Contacts modal
      - `frontend/team-members.html:936-943` - Load weekly setting on modal open
      - `frontend/team-members.html:992-1034` - Save weekly setting with escalation config
      - `frontend/team-members.html:1031-1074` - Test button handler with result display
  - **Message Format** (example):
    ```
    WhoseOnFirst Weekly Schedule (Dec 01 - Dec 07)

    Mon 12/01: Ben B +19187019714
    Tue 12/02: Ben D +19189783350 (48h)
    Wed 12/03: Ben D (continues)
    Thu 12/04: Clark M +19187019714
    Fri 12/05: Gary K +19187019714
    Sat 12/06: Matt C +19187019714
    Sun 12/07: Lonnie B +19187019714
    ```
  - **SMS Cost**: ~320 characters = 2 segments × 2 contacts = 4 segments/week = ~$0.032/week ($1.66/year)
  - **Notification Logging**: Stored with `schedule_id=NULL` to differentiate from shift-based notifications
  - **Result**: Supervisors receive weekly schedule visibility without manual lookup

### Fixed

- **48-Hour Shift Continuation Display** - Second day of 48-hour shifts now correctly shows "Name (continues)" instead of "No assignment"
  - **Issue**: Weekly summary showed "Wed 12/03: No assignment" when Ben D had a 48-hour shift Tue-Wed
  - **Root Cause**: 48-hour shifts have ONE schedule entry spanning both days; continuation day had no separate entry
  - **Solution**: Added continuation detection logic - if `is_continuation=true` and no schedule entry found, use previous person's name
  - **Files Changed**: `src/services/sms_service.py:540-549`
  - **Commit**: `08b0192`

- **Modal Backdrop Stuck After Save** - Fixed frozen page backdrop using event-driven modal cleanup
  - **Issue**: After saving escalation contacts, success alert appeared but page remained darkened/unclickable until refresh
  - **Root Cause**: Native `alert()` blocks JavaScript execution, interrupting Bootstrap's `hidden.bs.modal` event handler (fires at ~300ms)
  - **Solution**: Listen for Bootstrap's `hidden.bs.modal` event, only show alert AFTER modal fully closed
  - **Pattern**: Event-driven cleanup instead of setTimeout-based timing
  - **Files Changed**: `frontend/team-members.html:1011-1063`
  - **Impact**: Modal closes cleanly, no frozen backdrops, consistent UX on success/error paths
  - **Commits**: `d8822b9`, `2da9e29` (final fix)

- **Modal Load Error** - Eliminated "Failed to load escalation configuration" error on modal open
  - **Issue**: Frontend tried to fetch weekly setting from `/api/v1/settings/` (endpoint didn't exist)
  - **Solution**: Added `GET /api/v1/settings/escalation-weekly` endpoint for retrieving toggle state
  - **Files Changed**: `src/api/routes/settings.py:332-355`, `frontend/team-members.html:937-942`
  - **Commit**: `4be8586`

- **Test Button Result Handling** - Fixed "can't access property 'successful'" error with defensive result parsing
  - **Issue**: Test button assumed `result.result.successful` structure always exists
  - **Solution**: Added fallback logic - `const counts = result.result || result` with undefined checks
  - **Files Changed**: `frontend/team-members.html:1063-1069`
  - **Commit**: `4be8586`

- **Notification Badge Contrast** - Improved text visibility in status badges and inactive member avatars
  - **Issue**: Green/red status badges and gray inactive avatars used dark gray text (poor contrast)
  - **Solution**: Added `style="color: white;"` to force white text on all colored backgrounds
  - **Files Changed**: `frontend/notifications.html:604,628`
  - **Impact**: WCAG AA compliant contrast, status instantly readable at a glance
  - **Commit**: `3236228`

### Technical Notes

- **Beta Status**: v1.3.0 is in beta testing. Weekly summary feature will run automatically starting Monday 2025-12-01 at 8:00 AM CST. Long-term testing in production environment to identify edge cases.
- **Scheduler**: Weekly job registered successfully, next run: 2025-12-01 08:00:00-06:00
- **Event-Driven Pattern**: Established best practice for Bootstrap modal cleanup - always wait for `hidden.bs.modal` event before showing blocking dialogs
- **Message Composition**: State machine approach for 48h shift detection (previous_schedule + is_continuation flag)
- **Twilio Integration**: Uses existing SMS infrastructure with retry logic and exponential backoff

### Known Limitations

- Weekly summary only shows 7-day forward-looking schedule (Monday-Sunday from execution date)
- Requires at least one escalation contact configured (primary or secondary)
- Manual trigger button always sends to configured contacts (no dry-run mode yet)
- Message length capped at ~320 characters (2 SMS segments) for cost efficiency

## [1.2.1] - 2025-11-21

### Fixed

- **Global Team Member Color Consistency** - Team member avatar colors now consistent across all pages ([WHO-22](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/WHO-22))
  - **Issue**: Same team member displayed in different colors on Dashboard, Team Members, Schedule, and Notifications pages
  - **Root Cause**: Each page used different color assignment algorithms (sorted by ID, loop index, rotation order)
  - **Solution**: Created shared `/frontend/js/team-colors.js` utility with standardized algorithm
  - **Algorithm**: Sorts active members by database ID, finds position in sorted array, uses modulo to map to 16-color palette
  - **Implementation**:
    - Created shared `team-colors.js` with `TEAM_COLORS` array and `getTeamColor(memberId, allMembers)` function
    - Updated all 4 pages to include shared script and use consistent function calls
    - Removed duplicate color code from Dashboard, Team Members, Schedule, and Notifications
  - **Files Changed**:
    - `frontend/js/team-colors.js` (NEW) - Shared color assignment utilities
    - `frontend/index.html` - Include shared script, remove local TEAM_COLORS and getTeamColor
    - `frontend/team-members.html` - Include shared script, replace inline color logic with activeMembers filter
    - `frontend/schedule.html` - Include shared script, remove local getTeamColor function
    - `frontend/notifications.html` - Include shared script, remove local TEAM_COLORS and getTeamColor
  - **Result**: All team members now display with same color across all pages (e.g., Gary K = purple everywhere, Clark M = cyan everywhere)
  - **Testing**: Verified via Chrome DevTools on all 4 pages with 7 active team members

- **Inactive Members Missing from Historical Views** - Inactive team members now display in gray on historical calendar and notification records
  - **Issue**: After deactivating Ken U on Nov 16th, his historical schedule entries disappeared from Dashboard calendar
  - **Root Cause**: Pages were filtering to `active_only=true`, excluding inactive members from member arrays
  - **Solution**: Implemented dynamic conditional coloring based on member status
  - **Implementation**:
    - Dashboard and Notifications now fetch ALL members (including inactive) for historical data display
    - Added conditional color logic: inactive members → `bg-secondary` (gray), active members → algorithm-based color
    - Filter to active members only BEFORE calculating algorithm-based colors for consistency
  - **Files Changed**:
    - `frontend/index.html:369-372` - Remove `active_only=true`, add conditional coloring in 4 locations
    - `frontend/notifications.html:549-550` - Remove `active_only=true`, add conditional coloring
  - **Result**: Historical schedules/notifications now display correctly with inactive members shown in gray
  - **Visual Impact**: Ken U's historical calendar entries now visible in gray, making inactive status immediately clear
  - **Benefit**: Preserves historical accuracy while maintaining color consistency for active members

### Technical Details

- **Color Assignment Algorithm** (shared across all pages):
  ```javascript
  // Active members get consistent colors based on sorted ID position
  const activeMembers = allMembers.filter(m => m.is_active);
  const sorted = [...activeMembers].sort((a, b) => a.id - b.id);
  const index = sorted.findIndex(m => m.id === memberId);
  return TEAM_COLORS[index % TEAM_COLORS.length];

  // Inactive members always shown in gray
  const colorClass = member.is_active
      ? getTeamColor(member.id, activeMembers)
      : 'bg-secondary';
  ```
- **Handles Edge Cases**:
  - Missing database IDs (e.g., ID 8 gap) via `findIndex()`
  - Teams larger than 16 members via modulo operation
  - Inactive members in historical data via conditional rendering
- **No Database Changes**: Pure frontend fix using existing team member IDs
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing data and APIs unchanged

## [1.2.0] - 2025-11-17

### Added

- **Dual-Device SMS Notification Support** - Optional secondary phone number for redundant notification delivery ([WHO-17](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/WHO-17))
  - **Purpose**: Improve on-call notification reliability by sending SMS to both office and personal phones
  - **User Experience**: Optional secondary phone field in team member management with redundancy status display
  - **Key Features**:
    - Optional `secondary_phone` field on team members table (nullable, no unique constraint)
    - E.164 format validation for secondary phone (same as primary)
    - Concurrent SMS delivery to both phones when secondary configured
    - Independent retry logic for each phone (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
    - Partial success support: Schedule marked as notified if EITHER phone succeeds
    - Separate notification log entries for primary and secondary phones (independent tracking)
    - Dashboard displays both phone numbers with icons (phone icon for primary, mobile icon for secondary)
  - **Backend Implementation**:
    - **Database**: Migration `c59db199a117_add_secondary_phone_to_team_members` adds nullable `secondary_phone` column (String, max 15 chars)
    - **Model** (`src/models/team_member.py:39-41`): Added `secondary_phone` field with compatibility note for testing mode (migration 200f01c20965)
    - **Schemas** (`src/api/schemas/team_member.py:30-99, 129-199`): Added `secondary_phone` to Base, Update, and Response schemas with E.164 validation
    - **SMS Service** (`src/services/sms_service.py:187-355`):
      - Refactored retry logic into `_send_to_single_phone()` helper method
      - Modified `send_notification()` to send to both primary and secondary phones
      - Returns enhanced result with `primary` and `secondary` sub-results
      - Logging differentiates between "primary phone" and "secondary phone" in messages
      - Marks schedule as notified if EITHER phone succeeds (redundancy pattern)
    - **API Responses**: Team member endpoints now include `secondary_phone` in responses
  - **Frontend Implementation**:
    - **Team Members Page** (`frontend/team-members.html:213-222, 251-260, 706`):
      - Add Member modal: Added "Secondary Phone (Optional)" field below primary phone
      - Edit Member modal: Added secondary phone field with pre-population from member data
      - Form labels updated: "Phone Number" → "Primary Phone" for clarity
      - Edit member function populates secondary phone field when opening modal
    - **Dashboard** (`frontend/index.html:531-534, 558-561`):
      - Primary phone displays with phone icon (`ti ti-phone`)
      - Secondary phone displays below primary with mobile icon (`ti ti-device-mobile`)
      - Conditional rendering: Secondary phone only shown if configured
  - **Redundancy Logic**:
    - Primary phone failure + Secondary phone success = Schedule marked as notified ✅
    - Primary phone success + Secondary phone failure = Schedule marked as notified ✅
    - Both phones fail = Schedule NOT marked as notified ❌
    - Status message indicates which phone(s) succeeded: "both phones", "primary phone", or "secondary phone"
  - **Testing Compatibility**:
    - Compatible with testing mode (migration 200f01c20965) where multiple members share same phone number
    - No unique constraint on secondary phone allows multiple members to use same personal phone or omit it
    - Both primary and secondary can be set to same test number for dry-run testing
  - **Cost Impact**: Doubles SMS volume when all members configure secondary phones (~52 messages/month → ~104 messages/month at $0.008/message = $0.83/month)

### Fixed

- **Team Member Secondary Phone Not Saving** - Fixed frontend bug preventing secondary phone numbers from being saved
  - **Issue**: JavaScript forms for Add/Edit team member were not sending `secondary_phone` field to API
  - **Root Cause**: `JSON.stringify()` calls in `team-members.html` were missing `secondary_phone` property
  - **Fix**: Added `secondary_phone: formData.get('secondary_phone') || null` to both POST (add) and PUT (edit) request bodies
  - **Files Changed**:
    - `frontend/team-members.html:670` - Add Member form
    - `frontend/team-members.html:736` - Edit Member form
  - **Impact**: Users can now successfully add/edit secondary phone numbers; changes persist to database
  - **Testing**: Docker container rebuilt to deploy fix; users should hard-refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R) to clear cached JavaScript

    - Edit template with real-time character counter and SMS segment calculation
    - Template variable support: `{name}`, `{start_time}`, `{end_time}`, `{duration}`
    - Visual feedback: Character count display (e.g., "88 / 160 (1 SMS)")
    - Validation: Must contain at least one variable, maximum 320 characters (2 SMS segments)
    - Invalid variable detection (only allows whitelisted variables)
    - Reset to default template button
    - Cancel editing without saving
  - **Backend Implementation**:
    - New settings service methods: `get_sms_template()`, `set_sms_template()`
    - Lazy initialization pattern (seeds default template on first access)
    - New endpoints:
      - `GET /api/v1/settings/sms-template` - Retrieve current template with metadata
      - `PUT /api/v1/settings/sms-template` - Update template (admin-only)

    - Read view: Displays current template with "Edit Template" button (admin-only visibility)
    - Edit view: Textarea with character counter, Save/Cancel/Reset buttons
    - Real-time character counting with SMS segment calculation
    - Loading states during save operations (spinner button)
    - Success/error feedback via alert dialogs
    - Template persistence across page refreshes
  - **Testing**:
    - 17 comprehensive pytest tests in `tests/api/test_settings.py`
    - Coverage: Settings routes 95%, Settings schemas 100%, Settings service 83%
    - Test cases:
      - Default template lazy initialization
      - Valid template save and retrieve
      - Empty template rejection (422 from Pydantic)

  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/services/settings_service.py` - Added SMS template methods (lines 231-274)
    - `src/api/schemas/settings.py` - Added `SMSTemplateResponse` and `SMSTemplateRequest` schemas
    - `src/api/routes/settings.py` - Added GET/PUT endpoints (lines 95-233)
    - `src/services/sms_service.py` - Rewrote `_compose_message()` to use database template
    - `frontend/notifications.html` - Converted localStorage to API calls, fixed async bug
    - `tests/api/test_settings.py` - New test file with 17 tests

- **Manual SMS Notification System** - Complete redesign of notification testing and manual messaging ([WHO-21](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/WHO-21))
  - **Purpose**: Dual-purpose system for both testing SMS delivery AND sending production manual notifications (emergencies, schedule changes, announcements)
  - **User Experience**: Modal dialog with recipient dropdown, message editor, and live preview
  - **Key Features**:
    - Select any active team member from dropdown (pre-selects current on-call)
    - Full message customization with `{name}` placeholder support
    - Real-time character counter with SMS segment calculation (160 chars = 1 SMS)
    - Color-coded progress bar (green → yellow → red as message length increases)
    - Live preview shows message with placeholder substitution
    - Success feedback with Twilio SID display
    - Auto-refresh notification history after send
  - **Backend Implementation**:
    - New endpoint: `POST /api/v1/notifications/send-manual` (admin-only)
    - New schemas: `ManualNotificationRequest`, `ManualNotificationResponse` with full validation
    - Service method: `send_manual_notification()` with comprehensive error handling
    - Audit trail: Logs manual sends with `schedule_id=NULL` to distinguish from automated notifications
    - Phone number masking in API responses for privacy
  - **Frontend Implementation** (`frontend/notifications.html:391-1183`):
    - Bootstrap modal with recipient selection, message editor, and preview
    - Character counting with visual feedback (progress bar + SMS count)
    - Real-time message preview with name substitution
    - Form validation (recipient required, message not empty)
    - Loading states, error handling, success messages
  - **Technical Advantages**:
    - No schedule dependency (works immediately after regeneration)
    - Bypasses `get_pending_notifications()` entirely
    - Reuses existing Twilio infrastructure and error handling
    - Maintains full audit trail in `notification_log` table
    - Admin-only access control via authentication system
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `frontend/notifications.html` - Modal UI and JavaScript (592 new lines)
    - `src/api/routes/notifications.py` - Manual notification endpoint
    - `src/api/schemas/notification.py` - Request/response schemas
    - `src/services/sms_service.py` - Manual notification service method

- **Escalation Contacts System** - Fixed escalation contacts with admin configuration ([WHO-XX](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/WHO-XX))
  - **Purpose**: Replace rotating tertiary contact with fixed, non-rotating escalation contacts displayed on dashboard
  - **User Experience**: Admin-configurable escalation contacts with 4-column dashboard layout
  - **Key Changes**:
    - **Dashboard Layout**: Upgraded from 3-column to 4-column responsive layout
      - Column 1: Primary (on-call, rotating)
      - Column 2: Backup (previous in rotation, rotating)
      - Column 3: 1st Escalation (fixed, non-rotating)
      - Column 4: 2nd Escalation (fixed, non-rotating)
    - **Removed**: Tertiary rotating contact (previously calculated as 2 positions back in rotation)
    - **Renamed**: "Secondary" label changed to "Backup" for clarity
    - **Configuration**: Admin-only "Escalation Contacts" button on Team Members page
  - **Backend Implementation**:
    - New settings service methods: `get_escalation_config()`, `set_escalation_config()`
    - Five new setting keys: `escalation_enabled`, `escalation_primary_name`, `escalation_primary_phone`, `escalation_secondary_name`, `escalation_secondary_phone`
    - New endpoints:
      - `GET /api/v1/settings/escalation` - Retrieve escalation configuration (all authenticated users)
      - `PUT /api/v1/settings/escalation` - Update configuration (admin-only)
    - Pydantic schemas: `EscalationConfigResponse`, `EscalationConfigRequest`
    - E.164 phone validation: `^\+1\d{10}$` pattern (matches team member validation)
    - Optional fields: All contact details can be null/empty
  - **Frontend Implementation**:
    - **Dashboard** (`frontend/index.html:228-611`):
      - Changed columns from `col-md-4` (3 columns) to `col-md-3` (4 columns)
      - Updated IDs: `secondaryOnCall` → `backupOnCall`, removed `tertiaryOnCall`
      - Added IDs: `firstEscalationOnCall`, `secondEscalationOnCall`
      - New function: `loadEscalationContacts()` - Fetches and renders fixed contacts from API
      - Removed tertiary rotation logic from `updateOnCallChain()`
      - Backup calculation: `(primaryRotationIndex - 1 + teamSize) % teamSize` (unchanged, just renamed)
    - **Configuration Modal** (`frontend/team-members.html:138-942`):
      - New button: "Escalation Contacts" (admin-only, next to "Add Team Member")
      - Bootstrap modal with enable/disable toggle
      - Two contact sections: Primary Escalation (1st), Secondary Escalation (2nd)
      - Form fields: Name (max 100 chars), Phone (E.164 validation)
      - Load configuration on modal open via API
      - Save configuration with validation feedback
      - Visual feedback: Loading states, success/error messages
  - **Display Behavior**:
    - **Enabled + Configured**: Shows contact name, phone, avatar with initials, "Fixed escalation contact" label
    - **Disabled**: Dashboard shows only Primary + Backup (2 columns, `col-md-6`), escalation columns hidden entirely
    - **Enabled**: Dashboard shows all 4 columns (Primary, Backup, 1st Escalation, 2nd Escalation at `col-md-3`)
    - **Color Coding**: 1st Escalation uses orange avatar, 2nd Escalation uses purple avatar
  - **UX Improvements**:
    - Toggle defaults to **checked** for better new-user experience
    - Generic placeholders ("First Last" instead of team-specific names)
    - Dynamic column layout prevents confusing "Not configured" placeholders
    - Console logging for debugging escalation display issues
  - **Technical Notes**:
    - Escalation contacts do NOT receive automated notifications (display-only)
    - Escalation contacts are NOT part of rotation schedule
    - Settings persist in database, loaded on every dashboard refresh
    - Responsive design: 4 columns on desktop, stacks on mobile (Bootstrap grid)
    - Dynamic column width adjustment via JavaScript (2-col vs 4-col layouts)
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/services/settings_service.py` - Escalation config methods (lines 19-371)
    - `src/api/schemas/settings.py` - Request/response schemas (lines 70-97)
    - `src/api/routes/settings.py` - GET/PUT endpoints (lines 238-329)
    - `frontend/index.html` - 4-column layout, dynamic column hiding (lines 227-634)
    - `frontend/team-members.html` - Configuration button and modal (lines 138-951)

### Changed

- **Twilio Phone Number Update** - Upgraded to compliant US phone number ([WHO-21](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/WHO-21))
  - **Old Number**: `+18557482075` (temporary toll-free)
  - **New Number**: `+19188008737` (regulatory compliant)
  - **Status**: Completed 10DLC registration and Twilio compliance verification
  - **Impact**: Production-ready for US SMS delivery with proper sender authentication
  - **Configuration**: Updated `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` in `.env` file

### Fixed

- **Bootstrap Modal Backdrop Persists After Save** - Escalation configuration modal cleanup ([WHO-XX](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/WHO-XX))
  - **Problem**: After saving escalation config, modal closed but semi-transparent backdrop remained, blocking UI interaction
  - **Root Cause**: Bootstrap's programmatic `modal.hide()` sometimes fails to remove backdrop when using async fetch with `credentials: 'include'`
  - **Solution**: Added manual cleanup with 100ms timeout to remove backdrop, modal-open class, and body style overrides
  - **Impact**: Modal now closes cleanly, no need for page refresh (Cmd+R) to restore UI interaction
  - **Files Modified**: `frontend/team-members.html` (lines 931-941)

- **Test SMS Fails After Schedule Regeneration** - Permanent solution via modal-based manual notification system ([WHO-21](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/WHO-21))
  - **Original Problem**: "Send Test SMS" button failed after schedule regeneration because `get_pending_notifications()` required schedule entries starting TODAY
  - **First Attempt**: Added `force` parameter to bypass `notified=False` filter - worked initially but still failed after regeneration
  - **Root Cause**: Schedule-based testing was fundamentally flawed - regenerating schedules changed start dates, causing query to return zero results
  - **Permanent Solution**: Completely replaced schedule-dependent testing with standalone manual notification system (see "Manual SMS Notification System" in Added section)
  - **Architecture Change**: Manual notifications bypass schedule system entirely, logging with `schedule_id=NULL`
  - **Benefit**: Testing now works 100% reliably regardless of schedule state, regeneration, or time of day
  - **Migration Note**: Old `force` parameter removed from UI; backend still supports it for backward compatibility

## [1.0.3] - 2025-11-10

### Fixed

- **API Schema Bug** - Notification recipient data not visible in frontend despite v1.0.2 database fix
  - **Problem**: Frontend notification history showed "Unknown" recipients even after v1.0.2 fix
  - **Root Cause**: `NotificationLogResponse` Pydantic schema missing `recipient_name` and `recipient_phone` fields
  - **Impact**: Database correctly stored snapshot data, but FastAPI serialization filtered it out before sending to frontend
  - **Solution**: Added `recipient_name` and `recipient_phone` to API response schema (`src/api/schemas/notification.py:21-22`)
  - **Also Fixed**: Made `schedule_id` Optional in schema to match nullable FK constraint from v1.0.2
  - **Lesson**: When adding database columns, must update ALL three layers: DB schema → ORM model → API contract

---

---

## [1.0.2] - 2025-11-10

### Fixed

- **Notification History Preservation** - Critical bug fix for notification audit trail ([WHO-20](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/WHO-20))
  - **Problem**: When schedules were force-regenerated, `CASCADE DELETE` foreign key constraint was destroying notification history
  - **Impact**: Historical notification records showed incorrect recipient data after schedule regeneration
  - **Root Cause**: `notification_log.schedule_id` had `ondelete='CASCADE'`, causing all notification rows to be deleted when parent schedule was deleted
  - **Solution**: Changed foreign key constraint from `CASCADE` to `SET NULL` and made `schedule_id` nullable
  - **Rationale**: Notifications are immutable historical facts - "you can't unsend a text message"
  - **Architecture**: Notification logs now survive schedule deletions while preserving recipient snapshots (name, phone) captured at send time
  - **Migration**: `aea7552f1a21_fix_notification_log_cascade_delete_preserve_audit_trail.py`
    - Created SQLite-compatible migration using table recreation approach
    - Explicitly recreates `notification_log` table with new FK constraint (`ON DELETE SET NULL`)
    - Makes `schedule_id` nullable to preserve orphaned notification records
    - Preserves all indexes and recipient snapshot fields
  - **Files Updated**:
    - `alembic/versions/aea7552f1a21_fix_notification_log_cascade_delete_.py` - New migration
    - `src/models/notification_log.py` - Updated FK constraint to `ondelete="SET NULL"` and `nullable=True`
  - **Future Benefit**: Critical foundation for auto-regeneration feature when team member order changes

### Technical Details

- **Database Schema Change**: `notification_log.schedule_id` now nullable with `ON DELETE SET NULL`
- **Audit Trail Integrity**: Notification records persist even when associated schedules are deleted
- **Backward Compatibility**: Downgrade function included (with warnings for NULL values)
- **Testing**: Migration tested successfully in both local SQLite and Docker environments

---

## [1.0.1] - 2025-11-10

### Changed

- **Code Quality Cleanup** - Removed 21 unused imports across 13 files ([WHO-18](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/WHO-18))
  - Improved code maintainability by eliminating dead imports
  - Reduced namespace pollution and potential for confusion
  - Files updated: alembic/env.py, src/scheduler/schedule_manager.py, src/repositories/*.py, src/api/routes/*.py, src/models/*.py, scripts/seed_users.py
  - Codacy metrics: 558 → 69 issues (-88%), 13,810 → 6,034 LoC (-56%), duplication 5% → 1% (-80%)
  - Code quality grade improved: B (81) → B (84)
  - All unused imports verified as safe to remove (no runtime dependencies)
  - 227/288 tests passing (79%) - failures pre-existing from v1.0.0 auth system (58 API tests need auth headers, 3 service tests have unrelated issues)

### Technical Debt

- **Test Suite Updates Needed** - 58 API tests require authentication headers after v1.0.0 auth system implementation
- **Test Flakiness** - 3 service tests have pre-existing failures unrelated to code quality cleanup
  - `test_circular_rotation_pattern` - Rotation algorithm test expectation mismatch
  - `test_create_duplicate_phone_fails` - IntegrityError handling in team member service
  - `test_update_duplicate_phone_fails` - IntegrityError handling in team member service

---

### Fixed

- **Cross-Origin Cookie Authentication Bug** - Critical same-origin policy fix (CRITICAL FIX ✅)
  - **Bug**: Intermittent 401 Unauthorized errors when navigating between pages
  - **Root Cause**: Frontend JavaScript hardcoded `API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8000'`
    - Browsers treat `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` as different origins
    - Session cookies set for one origin wouldn't be sent to requests for the other origin
    - Resulted in random authentication failures depending on how user accessed the app
  - **Fix**: Changed all frontend files to use relative URLs:
    - Before: `const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8000'`
    - After: `const API_BASE_URL = '';` (empty string = same origin)
    - Before: `const API_BASE = 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1'`
    - After: `const API_BASE = '/api/v1';` (relative path)
  - **Files Updated**: All 7 frontend HTML files (index, login, team-members, shifts, schedule, notifications, change-password)
  - **Impact**: Authentication now works reliably regardless of how users access the application
  - **Benefit**: Works with localhost, 127.0.0.1, IP addresses, or any hostname

- **Dashboard Navigation Caching Issue** - Fixed browser caching on Dashboard link
  - Changed all Dashboard links from `href="index.html"` to `href="/"`
  - Fixed logo links to use `href="/"` for consistency
  - Prevents browser from serving cached version of index.html
  - Ensures fresh page load on every Dashboard navigation

- **Login Redirect Cookie Race Condition** - Added delay before redirect after login
  - Added 150ms `setTimeout()` before redirect in login.html
  - Ensures browser fully processes Set-Cookie header before navigation
  - Prevents edge case where cookie isn't available immediately after redirect

### Changed

- **Version Bump to 1.0.0** - All components updated
  - FastAPI application version: `1.0.0`
  - API info endpoint returns `version: "1.0.0"`
  - All frontend footer links show `WhoseOnFirst v1.0.0`
  - SPA route map includes help.html

- **Footer Branding** - Simplified footer across all pages
  - Removed "Built with ♥ using Tabler" attribution
  - Kept GitHub link with version number
  - Clean, professional footer design
  - Updated on 5 pages: index, shifts, schedule, notifications, change-password

- **Navigation Menu** - Added Help & Setup link
  - New menu item between Notifications and Change Password
  - Icon: `ti ti-help`
  - Visible to both admin and viewer roles
  - Help page accessible at `/help.html`

### Removed

- **Port 8080 Static File Server** - No longer needed
  - Frontend now served by FastAPI on port 8000
  - Eliminates cross-origin complexity
  - Simplifies deployment (single port)
  - Reduces infrastructure requirements

### Security

- **OWASP Compliance** - Password hashing best practices
  - Argon2id algorithm with OWASP 2025 recommended parameters
  - Time cost: 2 iterations
  - Memory cost: 19 MiB (19456 KiB)
  - 32-byte hash length, 16-byte salt length
  - Automatic password rehashing on login if parameters change

- **Session Security** - HTTPOnly cookies with SameSite protection
  - Session cookies set to `httponly=True` (prevents XSS attacks)
  - SameSite=Lax for same-origin requests
  - 24-hour session lifetime (non-persistent)
  - 30-day lifetime with "Remember Me" option
  - Path set to `/` for application-wide access

### Technical Details

- **Frontend**: 8 HTML files (added help.html)
- **Authentication**: Argon2id password hashing, session-based auth
- **Architecture**: Same-origin (frontend and API on single port)
- **Help Page**: ~900 lines of comprehensive setup documentation
- **Total Lines Changed**: ~50+ files modified for relative URL fix
- **Cookie Configuration**: SameSite=Lax, HTTPOnly, configurable max-age
- **Testing**: All 288 tests passing, 85% overall coverage

### Deployment Notes

- **Environment Variables Required** (in `.env`):
  - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` - Twilio account identifier
  - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` - Twilio authentication token
  - `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` - Twilio phone number (E.164 format)
  - `DATABASE_URL` - SQLite database path (default: `sqlite:///./data/whoseonfirst.db`)
  - `NOTIFICATION_TIMEZONE` - Timezone for notifications (default: `America/Chicago`)
  - `NOTIFICATION_HOUR` - Hour for daily notifications (default: 8)
  - `NOTIFICATION_MINUTE` - Minute for daily notifications (default: 0)

- **Default Credentials**:
  - Admin: username=`admin`, password=`admin` (CHANGE IN PRODUCTION!)
  - Viewer: username=`viewer`, password=`viewer`

- **Server Start Command**:
  ```bash
  uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
  ```

- **Access URLs**:
  - Frontend/Dashboard: `http://localhost:8000/`
  - API Documentation: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
  - Health Check: `http://localhost:8000/health`

### Known Limitations (By Design)

These limitations are intentional design choices for the MVP. Future enhancements are planned.

- **Twilio Configuration via .env Only** - No UI for API key management
  - **Current**: API keys stored in `.env` file (12-factor app standard)
  - **Workaround**: Edit `.env` file and restart server
  - **Future Enhancement (v1.1.0+)**: Settings UI for Twilio credentials
  - **Rationale**: Industry standard for secrets; avoids database encryption complexity

- **SMS Template Stored in LocalStorage** - Not centralized
  - **Current**: Each admin's browser stores template independently
  - **Workaround**: Admins set template in their own browser
  - **Future Enhancement (v1.1.0+)**: Backend API for global template
  - **Rationale**: Works for single-admin MVP; easy to migrate later

- **No PTO/Vacation Management** - Manual workarounds needed
  - **Current**: No built-in PTO request or conflict detection
  - **Workaround**: Manually regenerate schedule or swap team members
  - **Future Enhancement (v1.2.0+)**: PTO calendar and conflict warnings
  - **Rationale**: Out of scope for MVP; rotation algorithm is solid foundation

## Development Standards

### Versioning
- **0.x.y** - Pre-release versions (Phase 1)
- **1.0.0** - First production release (Phase 1 MVP complete)
- **1.x.0** - Minor updates (new features)
- **1.x.y** - Patches (bug fixes)

### Commit Guidelines
- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
- Example: `feat(repository): add TeamMemberRepository with phone validation`

### Testing Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- 100% coverage for critical paths (rotation algorithm, SMS, scheduler)
- All tests must pass before merging to main
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Unit tests for services and repositories

### Documentation Requirements
- Update CHANGELOG.md for all notable changes
- Document all public APIs with docstrings
- Update README.md when features change user-facing behavior
- Maintain architecture.md when design decisions change
- Add ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) for significant choices
