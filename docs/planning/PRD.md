## Executive Summary

WhoseOnFirst is an automated on-call rotation and SMS notification system designed to manage fair scheduling for technical teams. The system ensures equitable shift distribution using a simple circular rotation algorithm, schedules the double-shift during the workweek (Tue-Wed) to minimize weekend impact, and automatically notifies on-call personnel at shift start times.

**Current Status:** Phase 1 MVP complete (v1.0.0) - Backend, frontend, testing, and Docker deployment all operational. Awaiting Twilio 10DLC approval (~1 week). Phase 2 (offline installer + authentication) in planning.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
- Manual on-call rotation management is error-prone and time-consuming
- No automated notification system for shift changes
- Difficulty ensuring fair rotation across team members
- Challenge in preventing individuals from being on-call multiple weekend days consecutively
- Need for flexible shift patterns (24-hour and 48-hour shifts)
- Team size fluctuations require dynamic schedule adjustments

### Target Users
- **Primary:** IT/DevOps teams of 5-10 members requiring on-call coverage
- **Secondary:** Team leads and managers who manage on-call schedules
- **Future:** Organizations with multiple teams requiring coordinated coverage

System shall support optional second phone number per team member for redundant notification delivery:
- Add optional "secondary_phone" field to team_members table
- Validate secondary phone in E.164 format (same as primary)
- Send SMS to both phone numbers when secondary is configured
- Display both phone numbers in Team Members page
- Log notifications for both numbers separately
- Allow independent retry logic for each number

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Database migration adds nullable secondary_phone column
- [ ] Team Members page shows secondary phone input field
- [ ] Frontend validates secondary phone format (E.164)
- [ ] Backend sends concurrent SMS to both numbers at shift start
- [ ] Notification log shows separate entries for primary/secondary
- [ ] Retry logic handles primary/secondary failures independently
- [ ] Dashboard escalation chain displays both numbers when configured

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use async/concurrent Twilio API calls for both numbers
- Secondary phone is completely optional (nullable)
- No impact to existing single-phone workflows
- Consider Twilio rate limits when sending 2x SMS per shift

**Dependencies:**
- None - independent feature

**Testing:**
- Test single phone (backward compatibility)
- Test dual phone (concurrent delivery)
- Test secondary phone validation
- Test notification log with dual entries
- Test retry logic for mixed success/failure scenarios

**REQ-050: Global Team Member Color Consistency System (WHO-22)**
**Status:** 📋 Planned
**Priority:** Medium
**Linear:** [WHO-22](https://linear.app/hextrackr/issue/WHO-22)

System shall provide consistent avatar color assignment for team members across all pages and sessions:
- Add `color` field to team_members table (VARCHAR(20), stores CSS class like "team-color-1")
- Assign color from 16-color WCAG AA palette on member creation
- Return color in all API responses (GET /api/v1/team-members)
- Replace page-specific color algorithms with database-driven colors
- Support manual color override via Team Members edit page (future)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Database migration adds `color` column to team_members table
- [ ] Assign colors to existing members (sorted by ID for consistency)
- [ ] Update Pydantic schemas to include `color` field
- [ ] Replace `getTeamColor()` functions on all 4 pages with `member.color`
- [ ] Gary K shows same color on Dashboard, Team Members, Schedule, and Notifications
- [ ] New members automatically get next available color from palette
- [ ] Color persists across sessions and page refreshes

**Implementation Notes:**
- Current issue: 3 different pages use 3 different color assignment algorithms
  - Dashboard/Notifications: Sort by ID → find position → modulo
  - Schedule page: Loop index → modulo (no sorting!)
  - Team Members page: forEach index → modulo (different sort!)
- Result: Same member appears in different colors depending on page
- Database approach provides single source of truth
- Consider "color pool" tracking to prevent collisions when all 16 colors in use
- Color field optional on creation (auto-assigned by backend)

**Dependencies:**
- None - independent feature

**Testing:**
- Verify Gary K shows same color on all 4 pages
- Test new member creation (gets next available color)
- Test color persistence across sessions
- Test manual color override (future enhancement)
- Verify existing members get consistent colors after migration

## Use Case: Typical Weekly Rotation

### Example Team Configuration
**Team Members:** Bob, Dave, Steve, John, Paul, Matt, Sam, Lance (8 members)

**Shift Pattern:**
- Shift 1: Monday (24 hours, 8am-8am)
- Shift 2: Tuesday-Wednesday (48 hours, 8am-8am)
- Shift 3: Thursday (24 hours, 8am-8am)
- Shift 4: Friday (24 hours, 8am-8am)
- Shift 5: Saturday (24 hours, 8am-8am)
- Shift 6: Sunday (24 hours, 8am-8am)

### Week 1 Assignments
| Shift | Day(s) | Duration | Assigned To |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Monday | 24h | Bob |
| 2 | Tue-Wed | 48h | Dave |
| 3 | Thursday | 24h | Steve |
| 4 | Friday | 24h | John |
| 5 | Saturday | 24h | Paul |
| 6 | Sunday | 24h | Matt |

*Note: Sam and Lance rotate in during Week 2*

### Week 2 Assignments (Continuous Rotation)
| Shift | Day(s) | Duration | Assigned To |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Monday | 24h | Sam |
| 2 | Tue-Wed | 48h | Lance |
| 3 | Thursday | 24h | Bob |
| 4 | Friday | 24h | Dave |
| 5 | Saturday | 24h | Steve |
| 6 | Sunday | 24h | John |

### Fairness Algorithm (Circular Rotation)
- Formula: `shifts_elapsed = (week * shift_count) + shift_index`
- Member assignment: `member_index = shifts_elapsed % team_size`
- **All team members cycle through all shifts continuously**
- No special weekend logic needed - 48h Tue-Wed shift distributes burden fairly
- With 8 members and 6 shifts, two people are "off" each week, rotating through team
- Over 8 weeks, every member gets equal distribution of all shifts including the double shift

**Implementation:** 100% test coverage in `tests/test_rotation_algorithm.py`

## Sample SMS Messages

### Standard Shift Start Notification (Editable Template)
```
WhoseOnFirst: Your on-call shift has started.
Duration: 24 hours (until 8:00 AM CST tomorrow)
Questions? Contact admin.
```

### Multi-Day Shift Notification (Editable Template)
```
WhoseOnFirst: Your 48h shift has started.
Until 8:00 AM CST Thursday. Questions? Contact admin.
```

**Note:** SMS template editable in Notifications page (stored in LocalStorage for MVP, backend API planned in REQ-034).

---

## Out of Scope

The following features are explicitly out of scope for initial releases:
- Voice call notifications (SMS only for MVP)
- Integration with ticketing systems (Phase 4+)
- Automated incident escalation (not scheduling focus)
- On-call payment/compensation tracking (HR/payroll system responsibility)
- Advanced PTO conflict detection (REQ-035 provides basic support)
- Self-service shift swapping without admin approval (requires auth expansion)

---

## Dependencies

### External Services
- ✅ Twilio API (SMS provider) - Integration complete, pending 10DLC approval
- 📋 RHEL 10 VM (production environment) - Available, deployment pending

### Internal Dependencies
- None - self-contained application

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|--------|
| Twilio API outage | High | Low | Retry logic, notification logs, admin alerts | ✅ Mitigated |
| Schedule algorithm bug | High | Medium | 100% test coverage, manual override capability | ✅ Mitigated |
| SMS delivery failures | Medium | Medium | 3x retry with exponential backoff | ✅ Mitigated |
| Database corruption | High | Low | WAL journal mode, Docker named volumes, backup strategy | ✅ Mitigated |
| Timezone handling errors | Medium | Medium | America/Chicago via pytz, extensive testing | ✅ Mitigated |
| Team member churn | Low | High | Simple UI for add/remove, auto rotation reordering | ✅ Mitigated |
| Twilio 10DLC approval delay | Medium | Medium | Working integration ready, awaiting approval | 🔄 Monitoring |
