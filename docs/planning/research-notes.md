## Research Session 1: Framework Selection (FastAPI vs Flask)

### Key Findings

#### FastAPI Advantages (2024-2025)
Based on multiple sources including Better Stack Community, Syntha.ai, and developer surveys:

- **Modern Python Features:** Built on Starlette with native async/await support (ASGI)
- **Automatic API Documentation:** Built-in Swagger UI and ReDoc - critical for future integrations
- **Type Safety:** Uses Python type hints for automatic validation and documentation
- **Performance:** Significantly faster than Flask due to ASGI architecture
- **Developer Experience:** Auto-completion and IDE support through type hints reduces bugs by ~30%
- **Growing Ecosystem:** 70%+ GitHub star growth 2024-2025, indicating strong community momentum
- **Future-Proof:** Designed for modern Python (3.7+) with async-first architecture

#### Flask Comparison
- **Maturity:** Introduced 2010, stable and well-tested
- **Simplicity:** Minimalist design, good for small projects
- **WSGI:** Synchronous by default (can add async with extensions)
- **Manual Setup:** Requires additional work for API docs, validation
- **Traditional Web Apps:** Better suited for server-side rendered templates

#### Recommendation: **FastAPI**
**Rationale:** While Flask is mature and stable, FastAPI's native async support, automatic API documentation, and type safety make it the better choice for 2025. The auto-generated Swagger UI will be invaluable when:
- Adding Microsoft Teams integration (Phase 3)
- Implementing REST API for external systems
- Onboarding new developers
- Testing endpoints during development

The learning curve is minimal since FastAPI uses standard Python type hints, and the performance benefits will scale as the system grows.

## Research Session 2: Job Scheduling (APScheduler vs System Cron)

### APScheduler Investigation

#### Core Capabilities
From APScheduler documentation and Better Stack Community:

- **Three Trigger Types:**
  1. **Date Trigger:** One-time execution at specific moment
  2. **Interval Trigger:** Recurring at regular intervals
  3. **Cron Trigger:** Complex time-based schedules (what we need)

- **Scheduler Types:**
  - `BlockingScheduler`: Standalone applications
  - `BackgroundScheduler`: **Recommended for FastAPI** - runs in background thread
  - `AsyncIOScheduler`: For pure async applications

#### Cron Trigger Syntax for Our Use Case
```python
from apscheduler.schedulers.background import BackgroundScheduler
from apscheduler.triggers.cron import CronTrigger

scheduler = BackgroundScheduler(timezone='America/Chicago')

# Daily at 8:00 AM CST
scheduler.add_job(
    send_oncall_notifications,
    CronTrigger(hour=8, minute=0),
    id='daily_oncall_notification'
)
```

#### Key Features for Our Project
- **Timezone Support:** Native support for pytz/zoneinfo (critical for CST)
- **Job Persistence:** Can store jobs in SQLite (survives restarts)
- **Missed Job Execution:** Configurable behavior if job missed during downtime
- **Job Monitoring:** Events for job execution, errors, missed runs
- **Jitter Support:** Can randomize execution time slightly to prevent stampede

#### Why APScheduler Over System Cron
1. **Cross-Platform:** Works on macOS (dev), Proxmox (test), RHEL 10 (prod)
2. **Application-Integrated:** No external dependencies, easier Docker deployment
3. **Timezone-Aware:** System cron has timezone complications
4. **Programmatic Control:** Can manage jobs via API
5. **Testing:** Easy to test locally without system cron access
6. **Job Persistence:** Built-in SQLite job store

#### Integration with FastAPI
From NeuralNine tutorial and DEV Community best practices:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from apscheduler.schedulers.background import BackgroundScheduler

app = FastAPI()
scheduler = BackgroundScheduler()

@app.on_event("startup")
def startup_event():
    scheduler.start()

@app.on_event("shutdown")
def shutdown_event():
    scheduler.shutdown()
```

## Research Session 3: Twilio SMS Integration

### Twilio Python SDK

#### Installation & Setup
```bash
pip install twilio==9.2.3
```

#### Basic SMS Sending Pattern
From Twilio documentation and multiple tutorials:

```python
from twilio.rest import Client
import os

# Credentials from environment variables (best practice)
account_sid = os.getenv('TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID')
auth_token = os.getenv('TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN')
from_number = os.getenv('TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER')

client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)

message = client.messages.create(
    body="WhoseOnFirst: Your on-call shift has started.",
    from_=from_number,
    to='+15551234567'  # E.164 format required
)

# message.sid contains unique identifier for tracking
```

#### Best Practices (From Twilio Docs & Community)
1. **Environment Variables:** Never hardcode credentials
2. **Error Handling:** Wrap in try/except, Twilio raises exceptions on failure
3. **Message Length:** Keep under 160 characters to avoid segmentation charges
4. **Phone Format:** Always use E.164 format (+1XXXXXXXXXX)
5. **Rate Limiting:** Twilio has rate limits, batch sends if needed
6. **Logging:** Store message.sid for audit trail and troubleshooting
7. **Retry Logic:** Implement exponential backoff for transient failures

#### Trial Account Limitations
- Can only send to verified phone numbers
- Messages prefixed with "Sent from a Twilio trial account"
- Limited free credits
- Recommend upgrading for production use

#### Message Delivery Status
```python
# Can query delivery status using SID
message = client.messages(message_sid).fetch()
print(message.status)  # queued, sent, delivered, failed, undelivered
```

## Research Session 4: Database Selection (SQLite vs PostgreSQL)

### SQLite - Phase 1 Recommendation

#### Advantages for Small Teams (5-10 users)
From multiple sources (Chat2DB, DataCamp, Stack Exchange):

- **Zero Configuration:** No separate DB server required
- **Serverless:** Runs in-process, single file database
- **Lightweight:** Minimal memory footprint (~200MB typical)
- **Portable:** Easy backups (just copy the .db file)
- **ACID Compliant:** Reliable transactions despite simplicity
- **Cross-Platform:** Works identically on macOS, Linux, Windows
- **Perfect for Read-Heavy:** Our app is 95% reads (schedule lookups)

#### SQLite Limitations (Why We'll Migrate Later)
- **Write Concurrency:** Locks entire database during writes
- **No Built-in Security:** Relies on file system permissions
- **Limited Scalability:** Struggles with >1TB data or high write concurrency
- **No User Management:** No row-level security or user roles

#### Use Cases Where SQLite Excels
- Mobile applications
- Embedded systems
- Low-concurrency applications (our case in Phase 1)
- Development and testing
- Applications with <20 concurrent users

### PostgreSQL - Future Migration Path

#### When to Migrate
Based on research from Medium (PostgreSQL vs SQLite in 2025):

**Triggers for Migration:**
- Multiple concurrent admin users (Phase 2)
- More than 10 team members
- High-frequency schedule updates
- Need for row-level security
- Multi-team support (Phase 4)

#### PostgreSQL Advantages
- **Concurrency:** MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) allows multiple writers
- **Advanced Features:** JSON types, full-text search, window functions
- **Security:** Built-in authentication, row-level security, SSL
- **Scalability:** Horizontal scaling via partitioning/sharding
- **Ecosystem:** Rich extension ecosystem (PostGIS, TimescaleDB, etc.)

#### Migration Strategy
Use SQLAlchemy ORM (database-agnostic):
```python
# Single line change to migrate
# SQLite: sqlite:///./whoseonfirst.db
# PostgreSQL: postgresql://user:pass@localhost/whoseonfirst
```

## Key Insights from Research

### 1. FastAPI is the Clear Winner in 2025
The ecosystem has shifted hard toward FastAPI for API-first applications. Reddit discussions and developer surveys show Flask is still relevant for traditional web apps, but FastAPI is superior for:
- Microservices
- API-driven applications
- Modern Python projects
- Applications needing async support

### 2. APScheduler is Production-Ready
Multiple production examples of APScheduler handling critical scheduled tasks. Key is using BackgroundScheduler (not BlockingScheduler) when embedding in web frameworks.

### 3. Start Simple with SQLite
Multiple sources confirm SQLite is perfectly acceptable for small-team applications. The "SQLite vs PostgreSQL" debate is only relevant at scale. Our Phase 1 requirements (7-10 users, mostly reads) are well within SQLite's sweet spot.

### 4. Twilio is Reliable but Requires Proper Error Handling
Twilio's Python SDK is mature and well-documented. Critical to implement:
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Comprehensive logging of SIDs
- Status polling for delivery confirmation
- Rate limit awareness

### 5. Type Hints are Essential
FastAPI's reliance on type hints isn't just for show - it provides:
- Runtime validation
- Automatic API documentation
- IDE auto-completion
- Reduced bugs

This aligns with modern Python best practices (PEP 484, 585, 604).

## Performance Benchmarks (From Research)

### FastAPI vs Flask Performance
From various benchmark sources:
- **Requests/second:** FastAPI ~20K, Flask ~3K (WSGI) on same hardware
- **Async operations:** FastAPI native, Flask requires extensions
- **Cold start time:** Similar (~100ms)
- **Memory usage:** FastAPI slightly higher due to Starlette/Pydantic

*Note: Our application isn't performance-critical, but async support helps with Twilio API calls*

### SQLite Performance Characteristics
From Anton Putra's benchmarks:
- **Read Performance:** Excellent (comparable to PostgreSQL for <100K rows)
- **Write Performance:** Good for low concurrency (<10 concurrent writers)
- **Database Size:** Tested reliably up to ~140GB
- **Benchmark caveat:** Performance degrades with high write concurrency

Our app profile:
- ~10 reads/minute (schedule lookups)
- ~1 write/day (schedule updates)
- Small database (<1MB expected)

**Verdict:** SQLite is overkill for our needs, zero performance concerns

## Potential Pitfalls Identified

### 1. Timezone Handling
**Risk:** Incorrect timezone handling could cause notifications at wrong times  
**Mitigation:** 
- Use `pytz` or `zoneinfo` explicitly
- Store all times in UTC in database
- Convert to CST only for display/scheduling
- Comprehensive timezone tests

### 2. Scheduler Persistence
**Risk:** System restart causes missed notifications  
**Mitigation:**
- Use APScheduler's SQLite job store
- Implement "catch-up" logic on startup
- Log all scheduled jobs
- Monitor for missed executions

### 3. Twilio Rate Limits
**Risk:** Multiple team notifications could hit rate limits  
**Mitigation:**
- Batch sends with small delays
- Implement exponential backoff
- Monitor Twilio console for limits
- Cache Twilio client instance

### 4. Daylight Saving Time
**Risk:** CST/CDT transitions could cause 1-hour offset  
**Mitigation:**
- Use timezone-aware datetime objects
- Let pytz/zoneinfo handle DST transitions
- Test specifically during DST change dates

## Alternative Technologies Considered

### Alternatives to FastAPI
- **Flask:** More mature but lacks modern features
- **Django:** Too heavy for our simple use case, includes ORM we don't need full features of
- **Sanic:** Similar to FastAPI but smaller ecosystem

**Verdict:** FastAPI's automatic documentation alone justifies the choice

### Alternatives to APScheduler
- **Celery Beat:** Overkill, requires Redis/RabbitMQ message broker
- **System Cron:** Platform-dependent, harder to test
- **Airflow:** Enterprise workflow orchestration, massive overkill
- **Custom solution:** Reinventing the wheel

**Verdict:** APScheduler is the right tool for the job

### Alternatives to Twilio
- **AWS SNS:** More complex setup, overkill for SMS only
- **MessageBird:** Similar to Twilio, less documentation
- **Plivo:** Another alternative, but Twilio has better Python SDK
- **Vonage (Nexmo):** Viable but smaller community

**Verdict:** Twilio is industry standard with excellent documentation
