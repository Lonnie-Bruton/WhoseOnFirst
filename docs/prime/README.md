# Prime Session Logs

This directory contains timestamped session context logs generated by the `/prime` command.

## Purpose

Prime logs capture comprehensive session context at the start of each development session:

- Git commits and branch status
- Linear active issues and priorities
- Memento insights from past sessions
- Code verification with file:line references
- Technical baseline and Docker status
- Next actions with specific entry points

## Usage

**Generate a new prime log**:
```bash
/prime
```

**Quick startup with prime**:
```bash
/go
```

## File Naming

Logs use timestamp format: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md`

Example: `2025-11-21-143022.md` (November 21, 2025 at 2:30:22 PM)

## Searching Logs

**Find logs by date**:
```bash
ls docs/prime/2025-11-21*
```

**Search log content**:
```bash
grep -r "WHO-22" docs/prime/
grep -r "escalation contacts" docs/prime/
```

**Recent sessions**:
```bash
ls -lt docs/prime/ | head -10
```

## Git Tracking

Prime logs are **excluded from git** (see `.gitignore`) as they are local session artifacts.

Each developer maintains their own session history locally.

## Retention

Logs are kept indefinitely locally but not committed to the repository.

Consider archiving logs older than 90 days to keep the directory manageable.
