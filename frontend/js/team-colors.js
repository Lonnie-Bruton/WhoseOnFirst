/**
 * Team Member Color Utilities
 *
 * Provides consistent color assignment for team member avatars across all pages.
 *
 * Algorithm: Sort members by ID, find index in sorted array, use modulo for color.
 * This ensures the same member always gets the same color regardless of page or data ordering.
 *
 * Handles ID gaps gracefully (e.g., if ID 8 is deleted, ID 9 still gets consistent color).
 *
 * Color repetition: For teams larger than 16 members, colors wrap around using modulo.
 * This is acceptable as the schedule rotation naturally spreads members across the calendar.
